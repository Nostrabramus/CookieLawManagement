-------------

This chapter covers the TypoScript :ref:`constants <constants>` and :ref:`setup <setup>` associated with
cookie_consent.

In order to use "Cookie Law Management" you necessary need to configure the page of the site to contain the cookie policy.

#. Go to the module WEB > Template.

#. In the page tree, select a page where a TypoScript template is located, mostly the root page of your website.

#. In the upper left corner of the module, select 'Constant Editor' from the dropdown.

#. Under 'Category' select 'AIPCOOKIELAW(11)' from the dropdown.

#. Go to the constant IdPageInformation (the sixth from the top) and set the UID of the page which contains the cookie policy.

There are many constants that allow full customization of the extension. You can find the complete list in the following section.
